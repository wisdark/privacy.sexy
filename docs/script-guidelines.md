## Name

- Choose a title that is easy to understand for all users, regardless of technical skill, yet remains technically accurate.
- Focus on privacy implications, avoiding complex or overly technical jargon.
- Maintain consistency in naming, avoiding linguistic variations.
- Use action-oriented language for clarity and directness. Use an instruction format like "do this, do that" for clear, direct guidance.
- Respect the official casing of brand names.
- Choose clear and uncomplicated language.
- It should start with an imperative noun.
- Start with action verbs like `Clear`, `Disable`, `Remove`, `Configure`, `Minimize`, `Maximize`. While exceptions exist, these prefixes help maintain naming consistency.
- The scripts that modify hosts file should start with `Block ..`.
- Favor the terms:
  - `Disable` over `Turn off`, `Stop`, `Prevent`
  - `Configure` over `Set up`
  - `Clear` over `Erase`, `Clean`
  - `Minimize` over `Limit`, `Reduce`
  - `Maximize` over `Extend`, `Delay`, `Postpone`, `Prolong`
  - `Remove` over `Uninstall`
  - `Improve` over `Increase`
- Structure your phrases for clarity, examples:
  - Prefer `Disable XX telemetry` over `Disable telemetry in XX`
