    Colors used throughout the application

    Colors are named according to the Vue Design System guidelines (https://github.com/viljamis/vue-design-system/wiki/Naming-of-Things#naming-colors):
        - Default: The default base color is `color-{name}`.
        - Darker than default: Shades are named as `color-{name}-dark`, `color-{name}-darker`, or `color-{name}-darkest`.
        - Lighter than default: Tints are named as `color-{name}-light`, `color-{name}-lighter`, or `color-{name}-lightest`.
