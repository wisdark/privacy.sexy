# Collections

This directory contains the **collection files**, which are the central source of truth for scripts and categories within privacy.sexy.

In addition to the collection files, this folder contains two special files:

- [`.schema.yaml`](./.schema.yaml): Provides the schema definition for collection files.
- [`collection.yaml.d.ts`](./collection.yaml.d.ts): Defines TypeScript typings for the collection files.

## Additional documentation

- Refer to [`collection-files.md`](./../../../docs/collection-files.md) for details on the structure of these files.
- To validate these files, use the `validate-collections-yaml` script. For instructions, see its [`README.md`](./../../../scripts/validate-collections-yaml/README.md).
