      ü§î Potential improvements:
          Use user-friendly GUI sudo prompt (not terminal-based).
          If `pkexec` exists, we could do `x-terminal-emulator -e pkexec 'path'`, which always
          prompts with user-friendly GUI sudo prompt.
      üìù Options:
        `x-terminal-emulator -e 'path'`:
            ‚úÖ  Visible terminal window
            ‚ùå  Terminal-based (not GUI) sudo prompt.
        `x-terminal-emulator -e pkexec 'path'
          ‚úÖ  Visible terminal window
          ‚úÖ  Always prompts with user-friendly GUI sudo prompt.
          ü§î  Not using `pkexec` as it is not in all Linux distributions. It should have smarter
              logic to handle if it does not exist.
        `electron.shell.openPath`:
          ‚ùå  Opens the script in the default text editor, verified on
              Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions.
        `child_process.execFile()`:
          ‚ùå  Script execution in the background without a visible terminal.

      `x-terminal-emulator` may return exit code `137` under specific circumstances like when the

      Unix signal 9) indicates the process was terminated by a SIGKILL signal, which can occur due
      to user action (cancelling the progress) or the system (e.g., due to memory shortages).

      been reproduced):

      - 130 (130 = 128 + Unix signal 2): Indicates the script was terminated by the user
        (Control-C), corresponding to a SIGINT signal.
      - 143 (128 + Unix signal 15): Indicates termination by a SIGTERM signal, suggesting a request
        to gracefully terminate the process.
